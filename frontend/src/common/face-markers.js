// FaceMarkers carries the reactive UI state for the face-marker overlay
// and the surrounding controls (sidebar eye-toggle, + button, inline
// name editor). State that depends on a specific photo (the marker
// array itself) lives on the Photo model and is read via
// `photo.getMarkers(true)` at render time; this singleton only carries
// state that is global to "is the overlay active right now".
//
// Fields:
//
//   mode  — null | FaceMarkerDisplay | FaceMarkerEdit. `null` means the
//           overlay is hidden; the two truthy values mirror the
//           constants in `options/face-marker.js`.
//   busy  — true while a marker-mutating API call is in flight. Sidebar
//           buttons gate on this to prevent overlapping reject / eject /
//           name-set requests.
//   pendingNameMarkerUid — UID of a freshly-created marker whose name
//           input should auto-focus after the overlay's save settles.
//           The sidebar consumes this to drive the inline naming UI and
//           emits `naming-started` to reset it back to "".
//
// The lightbox is the policy owner (it gates writes on
// `shouldShowEditButton()` etc.) and writes through the singleton; the
// sidebar reads from the singleton and emits sidebar→lightbox events
// for state transitions it wants to request.
